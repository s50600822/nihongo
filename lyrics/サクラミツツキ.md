サクラミツツキ

春の夜 一人だった
Haru no yo hitori datta
On a spring night, I was alone.

モノクロの空 ためいきが 消えてく
Monokuro no sora tameiki ga kieteku
In the monochrome sky, sighs fade away.

足早な 人の波
Ashi bayana hito no nami
A crowd of people walking quickly.

ただ見つめてさ ずっと待っていたんだ
Tada mitsumete sa zutto matte ita nda
I just stared and waited all the while.

サクラ ひらいても まだ寒い夜には
Sakura hiraite mo mada samui yoru ni wa
Even when the cherry blossoms bloom, it’s still a cold night.

思い出すんだ 君の顔を
Omoidasu nda kimi no kao o
I remember your face.

平気なの? 大丈夫さ ふざけて手を振る僕
Heiki na no? Daijōbu sa fuzakete te o furu boku
Are you okay? It’s fine; I’m jokingly waving my hand.

あの日 君と 交わした約束
Ano hi kimi to kawashita yakusoku
The promise we made that day.

僕らは 僕らは あの欠けた月の
Bokura wa bokura wa ano kaketa tsuki no
We, we are searching for the half of that crescent moon.

半分を探して
Hanbun o sagashite
Searching for the half.

孤独を 分け合う 事ができたなら
Kodoku o wakeau koto ga deki ta nara
If we could share our loneliness,

もう一度 誓うよ
Mō ichido chikau yo
I vow once more.

四角いベンチ座り ぼんやり眺める空
Shikakui benchi suwari bonyari nagameru sora
Sitting on a square bench, gazing blankly at the sky.

思い出すんだ 昨日のように
Omoidasu nda kinō no yō ni
I remember it like yesterday.

ささやかな笑顔も 些細な言い合いも
Sayakakana egao mo sasai na iiai mo
Even the small smiles and trivial arguments.

どれだけ僕を 強くさせただろう?
Dore dake boku o tsuyoku saseta darō?
How much did they make me stronger?

あれから あれから あの欠けた月の
Are kara are kara ano kaketa tsuki no
Since then, since then, searching for the half of that crescent moon.

半分を探して
Hanbun o sagashite
Searching for the half.

いつかは いつかは サクラの花咲く
Itsuka wa itsuka wa sakura no hana saku
Someday, someday, the cherry blossoms will bloom.

満月の元へと
Mangetsu no moto e to
Toward the full moon.

移り変わる街並 僕ら急かすよう
Utsuri kawaru machinami bokura seka su yō
As the changing streets hurry us along.

キミは今どこで 何をしてるの?
Kimi wa ima doko de nani o shiteru no?
Where are you now and what are you doing?

それなりの暮らし それなりの幸せ
Sore nari no kurashi sore nari no shiawase
A life of its own, a happiness of its own.

それでも まだ追いかけてる
Sore demo mada oikaketeru
Even so, I’m still chasing it.

僕らは 僕らは あの欠けた月の
Bokura wa bokura wa ano kaketa tsuki no
We, we are searching for the half of that crescent moon.

On a spring night, I was alone
In a monochrome sky, my sighs fade away
The swift wave of people
I just watched, waiting all the while
Even as the cherry blossoms bloom, it's still a cold night
I remember your face
Are you okay? It’s fine, I jokingly wave my hand
The promise we made that day
We are, we are searching for
Half of that crescent moon
If we could share our loneliness
I’ll vow once more
Sitting on a square bench, gazing blankly at the sky
I remember, as if it were yesterday
Even the small smiles and petty arguments
How much did they make me stronger?
Since then, since then, we are searching for
Half of that crescent moon
Someday, someday, to the full moon
Under the cherry blossoms
The changing cityscape seems to hurry us
Where are you now, and what are you doing?
A life of its own, a happiness of its own
Yet still, I am chasing
We are, we are searching for
Half of that crescent moon
If we could share our loneliness
Once more
Since then, since then, we are searching for
Half of that crescent moon
Someday, someday, to the full moon
Under the cherry blossoms
