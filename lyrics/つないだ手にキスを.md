つないだ手にキスを

そして　坊やは　眠りについた
息衝く　灰の中の炎　ひとつ　ふたつと
浮かぶ　ふくらみ　愛しい横顔
大地に　垂るる　幾千の夢　夢
銀の瞳のゆらぐ夜に　生まれおちた輝くおまえ
幾億の年月が　いくつ　祈りを　土に　還しても
ワタシは　祈り続ける
どうか　この子に　愛を
つないだ　手に　キスを


And then, the little one fell asleep
In the midst of the breathing embers of ash, one by one
The rising, swelling, and beloved profile
On the earth, thousands of dreams
In the shimmering night of silver eyes, you were born shining
No matter how many billions of years
Or how many prayers are returned to the soil
I will continue to pray
Please, give love to this child
A kiss on the joined hands
