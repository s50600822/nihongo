曇天


鉛の空重く垂れ込み
真白に淀んだ太陽が砕けて
耳鳴りを尖らせる
ひゅるりひゅるり低いツバメが
8の字なぞってビルの谷を翔る
もうじきに夕立が来る
曇天の道を傘を忘れて
歩く彼女は雨に怯えてる
ので僕も弱虫ぶら下げて空を仰ぐ
あちらこちらあんよは上手
珈琲屋に寄って一休み極めたら
帰れない帰らない
曇天の道をぶらりぶらぶら
歩く二人は足軽のごとく
危険好きの誰かのふりをする小心物共
曇天の道を傘を忘れて
歩く彼女は雨に怯えてる
ので僕も弱虫ぶら下げて空を仰ぐ


The leaden sky hangs heavily
The sun, stagnant in its whiteness, shatters
The ringing in my ears sharpens
A low swallow, darting about,
Drawing an 8, soaring through the gap between buildings
Soon, a sudden shower will come
On the cloudy road, she forgets her umbrella
Walking, she is frightened of the rain
So am I cowardly look up at the sky
Here and there, stepping up skillfully
Stopping by a coffee shop for a break, once perfected
I can't go back, won't go back
Wandering, wandering down the cloudy road
The two of us walk like foot soldiers
Pretending to be danger-loving cowards
On the cloudy road, forgetting an umbrella
She is frightened of the rain
So I also hang my weakness and look up at the sky
